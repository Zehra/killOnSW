# killOnSW

BZFS plug-in which kills players who use `ShockWave`.

## Notes:
* Useful for maps where it's a difficult to reach `ShockWave` or a form of competitition to do so.
* May act odd with `UselessMines` or plug-ins which fire ShockWaves on the on behalf of players.
* Also adjusts score to prevent point loss for players.
